<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Unicode Integration </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>SBCL has a simple-minded implementation of Unicode support: each
Unicode codepoint is a single Lisp character, and strings are
sequences of codepoints. This implementation meets the principle of
least surprise, but has left some rough edges; the project here
involves exploring some of those rough edges and smoothing them
down. The project involves: implementation and testing (from test
vectors and differentially) of a number of Unicode algorithms, and
(the interesting bit) integrating those algorithms in a tasteful way
in the language runtime: for example, by using the normalization
algorithm in symbol equality, allowing easy use of collation keys for
sorting, or syllable breaking in the pretty-printer or formatter.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Exploiting GMP for bignum and rational arithmetic </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>SBCL has a reasonably simple but decent implementation of arbitrary
precision integers and rationals; its design is also informed by the
Common Lisp specification, in particular support for bitwise operation
in two's complement.  GNU MP (GMP) offers sophisticated routines that
would be extremely useful when working with medium and large bignums
or rationals, but calls to GMP entails conversion to/from
sign-magnitude representation, and foreign function interface
overhead.  The project requires the integration of GMP in SBCL,
ideally as an optional module ("contrib"), the development of
efficient conversion algorithms between GMP's and SBCL's concrete
representations, and the determination of cross-over points between
SBCL's and GMP's routines.  This work would probably be appreciated by
symbolic computing applications (e.g. maxima).

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> A binary serialisation library </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Many applications depend on the efficient (both in terms of time and
of space) serialisation of data.  A few Common Lisp libraries address
this concern portably, and "fasl" files offer very powerful
serialisation to files.  Exploiting implementation-specific knowledge
and placing restriction on serialised data enables an efficient wire
protocol.  Such a wire protocol would enable applications to
efficiently exchange or store data (and even code) between programs,
SBCL versions, or, potentially, platforms.

<p>SBCL's support for random number generation is limited to an
implementation of the Mersenne Twister (MT19937) PRNG.  This is a good
general-purpose PRNG, but some applications require different
characteristics of the random numbers, whether that is specific
guarantees about correlations, suitability for cryptographic
algorithms, or just plain raw speed.  This project involves
implementing several PRNG algorithms, and integrating them into SBCL
in such a way as to allow library authors and end-users to
programmatically negotiate the choice of PRNG algorithm among multiple
implemented choices.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>Developers continually attempt to reduce SBCL's reliance on a single
"world" lock.  This effort has lead to the elimination of some
re-entrancy issues, and to the introduction of a few concurrency bugs,
many of them related to the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).  Some
bugs are easily triggered, other depend on rare race conditions.  Some
could be fixed with additional lockings, others through the use of
mostly non-blocking synchronisation techniques, and others still by
outright modifying the behaviour of the object system.  This project
requires the student to organise known or potential concurrency bugs
in PCL, SBCL's implementation of CLOS, and attempt to fix them.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">

<p>Variables are mapped to registers or stack locations in SBCL with a
straightforward graph-colouring allocator.  Graph colouring is a
well-known combinatorial optimisation problem, and, although it is
NP-Hard, some heuristic methods are known to perform very well in
practice.  Exploiting such methods in the register allocator would
enable code to avoid spills when register pressure is high; this is a
particularly pressing issue on x86.  Moreover, while SBCL's register
allocator allocates registers (or stack slots) to variables,
contemporary allocator obtain much better results by mapping registers
to values, thus allowing the values associated with a single variable
to be stored in different locations at distinct points in the code.
This can be achieved to a lesser extent by more closely tracking
values within a single basic block and by splitting live ranges in
multiple sections, if compensation code is inserted as needed.
Through any of these means, the project would improve the performance
of code that exhibits high register pressure.

<h2 id="sec-16"><span class="section-number-2">16</span> Selecting concrete representations cleverly </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-16">

<p>An essential trick to SBCL's performance is its ability to represent
the same data in multiple manners, as boxed values, or as
machine-native values, e.g. signed or unsigned words, or floating
point values in registers.  However, not all operations have the same
requirements: some, like arbitrary calls, are better served with boxed
values, while others, like floating-point arithmetic, are more
efficient on natively-represented values.  SBCL currently assigns a
single concrete representation for each variable.  This selection
algorithm can be revisited and improved, but the constraints under
which it operates could be relaxed as well: nothing prevents a
variable's values to be represented in different manners at distinct
program points, as long as conversion code is inserted at key
locations.  In particular, this additional leeway imposes a very low
overhead if it is only exploited within each basic block.  This
project requires creativity to understand an exotic combinatorial
optimisation problem and determine how best to tackle it and adapt
existing methods; if successful, it would likely result in the
development of a novel algorithm for a problem essential to the
performance of dynamically-typed languages, and its application in a
pre-existing compiler, thus showing clear practical improvement.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-20">

<p>Generational garbage collectors attempt to process the heap
incrementally by determining when writes to old objects may have
created new references.  SBCL implements such write barriers with
hardware memory protection.  This means that writes can only be
tracked at a coarse granularity (a page, at best), and that handling
writes to previously clean pages is a complex affair involving several
round trips between userspace and the operating system.  Another
approach is to modify the code generated by the compiler to explicit
write barrier instruction sequences; each approach offers different
performance characteristics, and it is not yet clear which is
preferable for SBCL.  Previous attempts at implementing card marking
write barriers showed interesting results, but still exhibit subtle
bugs.  If successful, this project would forward port one such
attempt, develop tests for the software write barriers, and implement
an architectural change that involves large portions of the code base.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-21">

<p>Integer division is notorious for being slow.  However, it is also
known that the divisor is constant in the vast majority of cases, and
serious compilers exploit that fact to simplify divisions into
sequences of simpler multiplications, shifts, and additions.  SBCL
implements such a simplification only for truncated division of
unsigned machine words.  Floor and ceiling are less commonly supported
natively in programming languages, and there is a dearth of literature
describing how to simplify them.  However, it is possible to do so,
for both signed and unsigned machine integers.  It is also possible to
specialise the routines for tagged arithmetic.  A complete execution
of this project would include the development of simplification
routines for signed and unsigned truncate, floor and ceiling divisions
by integer constants.  Some of the simplifications, particularly those
concerning tagged integers, will be widely applicable and likely
novel.

<p>Structure objects in Common Lisp support single inheritance and typed

implements slots of unboxed data by allocating them from the end of
(variable-length, because of inheritance) structure objects.  Access
to an unboxed slot thus first determines the size of the current
object in all but a few cases.  However, nothing prevents boxed and
unboxed slots from being interleaved, as long as alignment
requirements are respected and the garbage collector's scanning
routine for structures is suitably adapted.  A branch partially
implements this improvement, and the work is assuredly feasible.  If
completed, this project would lead to more efficient access to
structure slots, and potentially let structures be laid out compatibly

<p>SBCL's memory management system includes a page-level block allocator.
It is mainly used to manage large objects and thread-local allocation
regions.  The scheme exhibits at least two clear deficiencies. First,
large objects are always allocated on page boundaries, exacerbating
cache aliasing issues, in addition to, in effect, misaligning the
contents of vectors.  Second, normal (pointer-ful) and unboxed
(pointer-free) blocks are interleaved, but regular pages tend to be
write-protected and unboxed pages never are; these short ranges of
addresses with different properties increase the address space
management overhead for the operating system, which is reflected in
long times spent in system code.  There are likely other problems that
can be improved with little effort; for example, the proportion of
zeros in image files hints at a fragmentation issue.

<p>SBCL and CMUCL are recognized for the strength of their type-directed

pass.  That pass exhibits severe weaknesses in the presence of
recursion or of assignments: such non-trivial bindings are initialised
with a static type of T (barring any user-provided declaration), and
that type is iteratively tightened.  This approach has the advantage
of always assigning correct types at any time, even if a fixpoint is
not yet reached.  However, when compilation times are not an issue and
the analysis is executed until termination, initialising bindings with
a static time of NIL (the bottom type) and widening the type
assignments iteratively would result in the automatic derivation of
more precise types.  If completed, this project would implement such a
precise flow-sensitive data-flow analysis, and let it be enabled on
